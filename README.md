# CS-315-DATABASE-MGT-PROJECT
Database Management Final Project

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
I created a JavaFX GUI application to work with MySQL Database.

It is an application that is built to be used by Churches to keep Contact record of All Church Members

Also to keep record of all donations made to the church by Church members and Non-Members

The Application will also store the date of birth of Church Members. The use of this is to be able to celebrate Church members' Birthday every month

For the purpose of my project submission i am done.

But i would love to actually develop this application into an appliation that churches can actually use.

Currently the application works on MS-Windows, Linux, and UNIX Systems
